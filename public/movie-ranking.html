<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO ARJIT</h1>
<h2>MY BEST MOVIES AS OF 2024</h2>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I liked the vfx and the knowledge that the movie provides</p>
<h3>Chhichore</h3>
<p>This movie clearly depicts the burden student faces during the preparatory phase of the competetive examinations</p>
<h3>Ae Dil Hai Mushkil</h3>
<p>This movie is also very close to my heart as it shows that the person you love the most need not love you and also that in reality true loves are never achieved</p>
